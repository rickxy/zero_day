## Introduction

Vagrant is a platform for building and managing virtual machine environments, and the Zero_day project attempts to provide users practical experience with it. I will gain knowledge of how to build up virtual machines, provide them with necessary software, and use Vagrant to manage their configurations through this project.

## Requirements

Before getting started with the Zero_day project, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

- Vagrant: Install the latest version of Vagrant from the official website.
- Virtualization Software: Choose a virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware and install it on your machine.
- Code Editor: Use your preferred code editor to work with the Vagrant configuration files.


## Usage

Once you have the Vagrant environment up and running, you can use the following commands for common tasks:

- `vagrant up`: Start the virtual machine.
- `vagrant halt`: Stop the virtual machine.
- `vagrant ssh`: Access the virtual machine via SSH.
- `vagrant destroy`: Destroy the virtual machine.

Feel free to explore the project's code and customize the Vagrant configuration according to your needs.
